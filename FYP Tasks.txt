OWDelay

Threshold values
Packet loss information
·         Green – Packet Loss < 1 %
·         Yellow – Packet Loss >= 1%
·         Red – Packet Loss >= 10%

Time series
span 1 week or custom range.

Holt-Winters forecasting on the time series if anomalies occur (sudden change in ms)
Minimum value forecast

Search function for time series
Perform holt-winters on series.

Bandwidth:
1.       Two graphs similar to the ones found on the perfSONAR node but separated into  src -> dst and dst -> src
2.       Holt-Winters forecasting if possible to detect if anomalies occur (unexpected change in bandwidth)
